Plugin PyADam (Python Programming using ABAQUS for Concrete Dams)

To install the plugin, it must be created in the plugin folder and place all the files in this directory inside it. Be careful if there are already plugins with the same name; in this case, rename the plugins to avoid name conflicts or unzip to a different folder in abaqus_plugins.
